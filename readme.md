# The Globetrotter Challenge

Globetrotter is an interactive travel-based guessing game where players use clues to guess destinations. It features score tracking, an invite system, and engaging UI elements.

## **Dataset**

A starter dataset was provided, and I expanded it to over 100 destinations using AI tools like ChatGPT. The extended dataset is stored in `destinations.json`. To populate the database, I created a script `insert_data.py`, which inserts the data into the `destinations` table.et

## Tech Stack & Choices

### **Backend: Flask (Python)**

- **Why Flask?**
  - Flask's minimalistic design allows quick setup and scalability. Its flexibility enables seamless API development, making it a great choice for interactive applications like this project.

### **Database: PostgreSQL**

- **Why PostgreSQL over MongoDB/MySQL?**
  - PostgreSQL offers structured storage for destinations, clues, and users while ensuring scalability with ACID compliance and efficient indexing. Its JSONB support allows handling semi-structured AI-generated data seamlessly.

### **Frontend: React (TypeScript)**

- React with TypeScript ensures type safety and scalability. Redux manages state efficiently, while MUI provides a polished UI. Framer Motion enhances animations, React Confetti adds celebration effects, and html2canvas enables capturing and sharing game moments.

- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - **Redux** â€“ For state management.
  - **MUI** â€“ For styling components.
  - **Framer Motion** â€“ For smooth animations.
  - **React Confetti** â€“ For celebration effects.
  - **html2canvas** â€“ For capturing and sharing game moments.

### **Hosting & Deployment**

- **Railway for Backend** â€“ Easy Flask deployment with built-in PostgreSQL support.
- **Vercel for Frontend** â€“ Fast and scalable React hosting.
